# Hosting Apps/Static Pages

The `App` class lets you host web apps in the agent. This can be used for an efficient inner loop when building a complex app using Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit, as it lets you build, deploy, and sideload both an agent and a Tab app inside of Teams in a single step. It's also useful in production scenarios, as it makes it straight-forward to host a simple experience such as an agent configuration page or a Dialog.
