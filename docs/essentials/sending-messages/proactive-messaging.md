# Proactive Messaging

In [Sending Messages](./overview.md), you were shown how to respond to an event when it happens. However, there are times when you want to send a message to the user without them sending a message first. This is called proactive messaging. You can do this by using the `send` method in the `app` instance. This approach is useful for sending notifications or reminders to the user.

The main thing to note is that you need to have the `conversationId` of the chat or channel that you want to send the message to. It's a good idea to store this value somewhere from an activity handler so that you can use it for proactive messaging later.

```csharp 
    app.OnInstall(async context =>
    {
        // Save the conversation id in 
        context.Storage.Set(activity.From.AadObjectId!, activity.Conversation.Id);
        await context.Send("Hi! I am going to remind you to say something to me soon!");
        notificationQueue.AddReminder(activity.From.AadObjectId!, Notifications.SendProactive, 10_000);
    });

    storage[ctx.activity.from_.aad_object_id] = ctx.activity.conversation.id
    await ctx.send("Hi! I am going to remind you to say something to me soon!")
    # This queues up the proactive notifaction to be sent in 1 minute
    notication_queue.add_reminder(ctx.activity.from_.aad_object_id, send_proactive_notification, 60000)

// This would be some persistent storage
const myConversationIdStorage = new Map<string, string>();

// Installation is just one place to get the conversation id. All activities
// have the conversation id, so you can use any activity to get it.
app.on('install.add', async ({ activity, send }) => {
  // Save the conversation id in
  myConversationIdStorage.set(activity.from.aadObjectId!, activity.conversation.id);

Then, when you want to send a proactive message, you can retrieve the `conversationId` from storage and use it to send the message.
