# Listening To Activities

An **Activity** is the Teams‑specific payload that flows between the user and your bot.
Where _events_ describe high‑level happenings inside your app, _activities_ are the raw Teams messages such as chat text, card actions, installs, or invoke calls.

The Teams SDK exposes a fluent router so you can subscribe to these activities with `app.OnActivity(...)` using minimal APIs.

The Teams SDK exposes a fluent router so you can subscribe to these activities with `@app.event("activity")`.

The Teams SDK exposes a fluent router so you can subscribe to these activities with `app.on('<route>', …)`.

Here is an example of a basic message handler:


::: zone pivot="csharp"
```csharp
    app.OnMessage(async context =>
    {
        await context.Send($"you said: {context.activity.Text}");
    });
    ```
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="python"
```python
@app.on_message
async def handle_message(ctx: ActivityContext[MessageActivity]):
    await ctx.send(f"You said '{ctx.activity.text}'")
```
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="javascript"
```typescript
app.on('message', async ({ activity, send }) => {
  await send(`You said: ${activity.text}`);
});
```
::: zone-end



::: zone pivot="csharp"
In the above example, the `context.activity` parameter is of type `MessageActivity`, which has a `Text` property. You'll notice that the handler here does not return anything, but instead handles it by `send`ing a message back. For message activities, Teams does not expect your application to return anything (though it's usually a good idea to send some sort of friendly acknowledgment!).

[Other activity types](./activity-ref.md) have different properties and different required results. For a given handler, the SDK will automatically determine the type of `activity` and also enforce the correct return type.

## Middleware pattern


::: zone pivot="csharp"
The `OnActivity` activity handlers (and attributes) follow a [middleware](https://www.patterns.dev/vanilla/mediator-pattern/) pattern similar to how `dotnet` middlewares work. This means that for each activity handler, a `Next` function is passed in which can be called to pass control to the next handler. This allows you to build a chain of handlers that can process the same activity in different ways.

This means that for each activity handler, a `next` function is passed in which can be called to pass control to the next handler. This allows you to build a chain of handlers that can process the same activity in different ways.

```csharp
  app.OnMessage(async context =>
  {
      Console.WriteLine("global logger");
      context.Next(); // pass control onward
      return Task.CompletedTask;
  });
  ```

```csharp
app.OnMessage(async context =>
{
    if (context.Activity.Text == "/help")
    {
        await context.Send("Here are all the ways I can help you...");
    }

    // Conditionally pass control to the next handler
    context.Next();
});
    
  app.OnMessage(async context =>
  {
      // Fallthrough to the final handler
      await context.Send($"Hello! you said {context.Activity.Text}");
  });
  ```
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="python"
```python
@app.on_message
async def handle_message(ctx: ActivityContext[MessageActivity]):
    """Handle message activities using the new generated handler system."""
    print(f"[GENERATED onMessage] Message received: {ctx.activity.text}")
    await ctx.next()
```

```python
@app.on_message
async def handle_message(ctx: ActivityContext[MessageActivity]):
    """Handle message activities using the new generated handler system."""
    if ctx.activity.text == "/help":
        await ctx.send("Here are all the ways I can help you...")
    await ctx.next()
```

```python
@app.on_message
async def handle_message(ctx: ActivityContext[MessageActivity]):
    await ctx.send(f"You said '{ctx.activity.text}'")
```
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="javascript"
```typescript
app.on('message', async ({ next }) => {
  console.log('global logger');
  next(); // pass control onward
});
```

```typescript
app.on('message', async ({ activity, next }) => {
  if (activity.text === '/help') {
    await send('Here are all the ways I can help you...');
    return;
  }

  // Conditionally pass control to the next handler
  next();
});
```

```typescript
app.on('message', async ({ activity }) => {
  // Fallthrough to the final handler
  await send(`Hello! you said ${activity.text}`);
});
```
::: zone-end


> [!NOTE]
> Just like other middlewares, if you stop the chain by not calling `next()`, the activity will not be passed to the next handler. The order of registration for the handlers also matters as that determines how the handlers will be called.
