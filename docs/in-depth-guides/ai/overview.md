## Prompts

A `Prompt` is the component that orchestrates everything, it handles state management,
function definitions, and invokes the model/template when needed. This layer abstracts many of
the complexities of the Models to provide a common interface.

## Models

A `Model` is the component that interfaces with the LLM, being given some `input` and returning the `output`.
This layer deals with any of the nuances of the particular Models being used.

It is in the model implementation that the individual LLM features (i.e. streaming/tools etc.)
are made compatible with the more general features of the `Microsoft.Teams.AI`.
