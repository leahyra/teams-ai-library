> [!NOTE]
> Take a look at [Function calling](../function-calling.md) to understand how the `ChatPrompt` leverages tools to enhance the LLM's capabilities. MCP extends this functionality by allowing remote tools, that may or may not be developed or maintained by you, to be used by your application.

## Remote MCP Server

The first thing that's needed is access to a **remote** MCP server. MCP Servers (at present) come using two main types protocols:

1. StandardIO - This is a _local_ MCP server, which runs on your machine. An MCP client may connect to this server, and use standard input and outputs to communicate with it. Since our application is running remotely, this is not something that we want to use
::: zone pivot="typescript"
2. Streamable HTTP/SSE - This is a _remote_ MCP server. An MCP client may
 send it requests and the server responds in the expected MCP protocol.
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="csharp"
2. SSE - This is a _remote_ MCP server. An MCP client may
 send it requests and the server responds in the expected MCP protocol.

For hooking up to your valid remote server, you will need to know the URL of the server, and if applicable, and keys that must be included as part of the header.

## MCP Client Plugin

::: zone pivot="typescript"
The `MCPClientPlugin` (from `@microsoft/teams.mcpclient` package) integrates directly with the `ChatPrompt` object as a plugin. When the `ChatPrompt`'s `send` function is called, it calls the external MCP server and loads up all the tools that are available to it.

::: zone-end


Once loaded, it treats these tools like any functions that are available to the `ChatPrompt` object. If the LLM then decides to call one of these remote MCP tools, the MCP Client plugin will call the remote MCP server and return the result back to the LLM. The LLM can then use this result in its response.

::: zone pivot="typescript"
```typescript
import { ChatPrompt } from '@microsoft/teams.ai';
import { App } from '@microsoft/teams.apps';
import { ConsoleLogger } from '@microsoft/teams.common';
import { McpClientPlugin } from '@microsoft/teams.mcpclient';
import { OpenAIChatModel } from '@microsoft/teams.openai';
// ...

const logger = new ConsoleLogger('mcp-client', { level: 'debug' });
const prompt = new ChatPrompt(
  {
    instructions: 'You are a helpful assistant. You MUST use tool calls to do all your work.',
    model: new OpenAIChatModel({
      model: 'gpt-4o-mini',
      apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
    }),
  },
  [new McpClientPlugin({ logger })]
).usePlugin('mcpClient', {
  url: 'https://learn.microsoft.com/api/mcp',
});

const app = new App();

app.on('message', async ({ send, activity }) => {
  await send({ type: 'typing' });

  const result = await prompt.send(activity.text);
  if (result.content) {
    await send(result.content);
  }
});
app.start().catch(console.error);
```

# [Minimal](#tab/minimal)

```csharp
    using Microsoft.Teams.AI.Models.OpenAI;
    using Microsoft.Teams.AI.Prompts;
    using Microsoft.Teams.Api.Activities;
    using Microsoft.Teams.Apps;
    using Microsoft.Teams.Apps.Activities;
    using Microsoft.Teams.Plugins.AspNetCore.Extensions;
    using Microsoft.Teams.Plugins.External.McpClient;

    WebApplicationBuilder builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
    builder.AddTeams();
    WebApplication webApp = builder.Build();

    OpenAIChatPrompt prompt = new(
            new OpenAIChatModel(
                model: "gpt-4o",
                apiKey: Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("OPENAI_API_KEY")!),
                new ChatPromptOptions()
                    .WithDescription("helpful assistant")

                        "You MUST use tool calls to do all your work.")
                    );

    });
    webApp.Run();
```

```python
from microsoft_teams.ai import ChatPrompt
from microsoft_teams.mcpplugin import McpClientPlugin
from microsoft_teams.openai import OpenAICompletionsAIModel
# ...

# Set up AI model
completions_model = OpenAICompletionsAIModel(model="gpt-4")

# Configure MCP Client Plugin with multiple remote servers
mcp_plugin = McpClientPlugin()

# Add multiple MCP servers
mcp_plugin.use_mcp_server("https://learn.microsoft.com/api/mcp")
mcp_plugin.use_mcp_server("https://example.com/mcp/weather")
mcp_plugin.use_mcp_server("https://example.com/mcp/pokemon")

# ChatPrompt with MCP tools
chat_prompt = ChatPrompt(
    completions_model,

)
```

### Customize Headers

Some MCP servers may require custom headers to be sent as part of the request. You can customize the headers when calling the `usePlugin` function:

```typescript
import { ChatPrompt } from '@microsoft/teams.ai';
import { McpClientPlugin } from '@microsoft/teams.mcpclient';
// ...

.usePlugin('mcpClient', {
    url: 'https://<your-mcp-server>/mcp'
    params: {
      headers: {
        'x-header-functions-key': '<custom-headers>',
      }
    }
});
```
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="csharp"
### Custom Headers

Some MCP servers may require custom headers to be sent as part of the request. You can customize the headers when calling the `UseMcpServer` function:

```csharp
new McpClientPlugin()
    .UseMcpServer("https://learn.microsoft.com/api/mcp",
        new McpClientPluginParams()
        {
               HeadersFactory = () => new Dictionary<string, string>()
               { { "HEADER_KEY", "HEADER_VALUE" } }
        }
    );
```
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="python"
### Customize Headers

Some MCP servers may require custom headers to be sent as part of the request. You can customize the headers when calling the `use_mcp_server` function:

```python
from os import getenv
from microsoft_teams.mcpplugin import McpClientPlugin, McpClientPluginParams
# ...

# Example with Bearer token authentication
GITHUB_PAT = getenv("GITHUB_PAT")

if GITHUB_PAT:
    mcp_plugin.use_mcp_server(
        "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/",
        McpClientPluginParams(headers={
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {GITHUB_PAT}",
        })
    )

# Example with API key
mcp_plugin.use_mcp_server(
    "https://example.com/api/mcp",
    McpClientPluginParams(headers={
        "X-API-Key": getenv('API_KEY'),
        "Custom-Header": "custom-value"
    })
)
```

## Using MCP Client in Message Handlers

```python
from microsoft_teams.ai import ChatPrompt
from microsoft_teams.api import MessageActivity, MessageActivityInput
from microsoft_teams.apps import ActivityContext
# ...

@app.on_message
async def handle_message(ctx: ActivityContext[MessageActivity]):
    """Handle messages using ChatPrompt with MCP tools"""

    result = await chat_prompt.send(
        input=ctx.activity.text,
        instructions="You are a helpful assistant with access to remote MCP tools."
    )

    if result.response.content:
        message = MessageActivityInput(text=result.response.content).add_ai_generated()
        await ctx.send(message)
```
