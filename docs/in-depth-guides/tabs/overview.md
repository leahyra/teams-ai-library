# Tabs

Tabs are host-aware webpages embedded in Microsoft Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365. Tabs are commonly implemented as Single Page Applications that use the Teams [JavaScript client library](/microsoftteams/platform/tabs/how-to/using-teams-client-library) (TeamsJS) to interact with the app host.

This SDK does not offer features for implementing Tab apps in C#. It does however let you host tab apps and implement functions that can be called by Tab apps.

Tab apps will often need to interact with remote services. They may need to fetch data from [Microsoft Graph](/graph/overview) or invoke remote agent functions, using the [Nested App Authentication](/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/authentication/nested-authentication) (NAA) and the [Microsoft Authentication Library](/entra/identity-platform/msal-overview) (MSAL) to ensure user consent and to allow the remote service authenticate the user.

The `@microsoft/teams.client` package in this SDK builds on TeamsJS and MSAL to streamline these common scenarios. It aims to simplify:

- **Remote Service Authentication** through MSAL-based authentication and token acquisition.
- **Graph API Integration** by offering a pre-configured and type-safe Microsoft Graph client.
- **Agent Function Calling** by handling authentication and including app context when calling server-side functions implemented Teams SDK agents.
- **Scope Consent Management** by providing simple APIs to test for and request user consent.
