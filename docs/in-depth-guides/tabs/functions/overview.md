# Functions


::: zone pivot="csharp"
Agents may want to expose REST APIs that client applications can call. This SDK makes it easy to implement those APIs through the `app.AddFunction()` method. The function takes a name and a callback that implements the function.

Agents may want to expose REST APIs that client applications can call. This SDK makes it easy to implement those APIs through the `app.function()` method. The function takes a name and a callback that implements the function.

::: zone pivot="csharp"
```csharp
app.AddFunction('do-something', (context) => {
  // do something useful
});
```

This registers a REST API hosted at `http://localhost:{PORT}/api/functions/do-something` or `https://{BOT_DOMAIN}/api/functions/do-something` that clients can POST to. When they do, this SDK validates that the caller provides a valid Microsoft Entra bearer token before invoking the registered callback. If the token is missing or invalid, the request is denied with a HTTP 401.

The function can be typed to accept input arguments. The clients would include those in the POST request payload, and they are made available in the callback through the `Data` context argument.

```csharp
public class ProcessMessageData
{
    [JsonPropertyName("message")]
    public required string Message { get; set; }
}

// ...

app.AddFunction<ProcessMessageData> ("process-message", (context) => {
    context.Log.Debug($"process-message with: {context.Data.Message}");
});

```

app.function('do-something', () => {

});

```typescript
app.function<{}, { message: string }>('process-message', ({ data, log }) => {
  log.info(`process-message called with: ${data.message}`);
});
```

> This SDK does not validate that the function arguments are of the expected types or otherwise trustworthy. You must take care to validate the input arguments before using them.

::: zone pivot="csharp"
If desired, the function can return data to the caller.

```csharp
app.AddFunction('get-random-number', () => {
    return 4; // chosen by fair dice roll;
              // guaranteed to be random
});
```
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="javascript"
If desired, the function can return data to the caller. The return value can be a string, an object, or an array.

```typescript
app.function('get-random-number', () => {
  return '4'; // chosen by fair dice roll;
  // guaranteed to be random
});
```

If your function returns a number, that will be interpreted as an HTTP status code:

```typescript
app.function('privileged-action', ({ userId }) => {
  if (!hasPermission(userId)) {
    return 401; // HTTP response will have status 401: unauthorized
  }
  // ... do something
});
```
::: zone-end


## Function context


::: zone pivot="csharp,javascript"
The function callback receives a context object with a number of useful values. Some originate within the agent itself, while others are furnished by the caller via the HTTP Request.

The `AuthToken` is validated before the function callback is invoked, and the `TenantId`, `UserId`, and `UserName` values are extracted from the validated token. In the typical case, the remaining caller-supplied values would reflect what the Teams Tab app retrieves from the teams-js `getContext()` API, but the agent does not validate these.

> [!WARNING]
> Take care to validate the caller-supplied values before using them. Don't assume that the calling user actually has access to items indicated in the context.

To simplify a common scenarios, the context provides a `Send` method. This method sends an activity to the current conversation ID, determined from the context values provided by the client (chatId and channelId). If neither chatId or channelId is provided by the caller, the ID of the 1:1 conversation between the agent and the user is assumed.

> [!WARNING]
> The `Send` method does not validate that the chat ID or conversation ID provided by the caller is valid or correct. You must take care to validate that the user and agent both have appropriate access to the conversation.

To simplify two common scenarios, the context provides the `getCurrentConversationId` and `send` methods.

- The `getCurrentConversationId` method attempts to find the current conversation ID based on the context provided by the client (chatId and channelId) and validates that both the agent and the calling user are actually present in the conversation. If neither chatId or channelId is provided by the caller, the ID of the 1:1 conversation between the agent and the user is returned.
- The `send` method relies on `getCurrentConversationId` to find the conversation where the app is hosted and posts an activity.
